He is also an armored superhero known as Iron Man. Fresh off from defeating enemies the world over, Stark reluctantly agreed to serve as a consultant to Nick Fury's peacekeeping intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri during the Battle of New York. Due to the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion. After the Battle on the Norco, the final event of Aldrich Killian's War, he destroyed all of his armors with the Clean Slate Protocol. However, when the Avengers were officially reassembled, Stark created new armors to fight the remnants of HYDRA. Once the threat had been ended, Stark, with the help of Bruce Banner, built Ultron as a peace-keeping A.I. to protect the world, but it defected and chose to destroy humanity instead. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated. After the war, however, Stark retired from the team, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to sign with Thaddeus Ross and create the Sokovia Accords. However, Stark's strong support of the accords lead to a disagreement with Captain America, who very much opposed the plans. When Rogers proceeded further to disobey orders by protecting Winter Soldier, Stark led the man-hunt for his old ally, igniting the Avengers Civil War.","id":"T_39920D9245C4C3CC8A7A9E554E7773FC","title":"Iron Man : Iron Man : Iron Man","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_39920D9245C4C3CC8A7A9E554E7773FC/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man-2026.html","title":"Iron Man : Iron Man : Iron Man","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34079720.xml","DOCNO":"39920D9245C4C3CC95B10B014083B8A1","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_39920D9245C4C3CC95B10B014083B8A1"}},{"value":"0.025509709492325783","text":"Iron Man: I Am Iron Man!

The armor allows him to fly and contains various weapons for battle. He frequently improves the armor, giving it upgrades for battles and to perfect the systems. Iron Man wears a sophisticated suit of body armor containing various offensive weaponry. He has a number of suits aside from the current model. Some are mission-specific or prototypes for testing, others are older models kept for nostalgia or for research. He has developed a special briefcase to carry his armor in. As the multi-billionaire head of a global corporation and a genius-level inventor, Stark can procure or develop additional technology as needed as possible. The Iron Man Armor is arguably one of the most powerful forms of weapons technology developed by Tony Stark on the planet. Alone, the Mark I was sufficient enough to allow him to go through armed terrorists in order to escape. The Mark II was sufficiently powerful enough to go toe to toe with a more advanced and updated version of the armor (the Mark IV). The Mark III was able to easily dispatch some of the Ten Rings terrorists with ease and battle the Iron Monger suit, however, with some difficulty (due to the fact that it was powered by the first generation mini-Arc Reactor and the Iron Monger was powered by the second Arc Reactor he made upon his return). The Mark V, while lacking additional weaponry and flight capabilities, was still able to take on Vanko while he was just utilizing just the Whiplash harness and Stark relying on his repulsors. The Marks VI and VII proved to be the most powerful generation suits used by Stark. They were powerful enough to battle hordes of Hammer drones, Vanko with his own advanced armor, survive and battle two Asgardian gods (Thor and Loki, respectively) and hordes of alien foot soldiers and large transports (the Leviathan) with ease. The Marks 8 through 42 proved to be equally powerful generation suits as they were able to battle nano tech-enhanced human soldiers who themselves had enough strength to match any of the armors.","id":"T_39920D9245C4C3CC43CF099D7777D87E","title":"Iron Man : Iron Man : Iron Man Armors","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_39920D9245C4C3CC43CF099D7777D87E/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man-2026.html","title":"Iron Man : Iron Man : Iron Man Armors","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34079882.xml","DOCNO":"39920D9245C4C3CC309B8A76ED4CD007","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_39920D9245C4C3CC309B8A76ED4CD007"}},{"value":"0.01563798077404499","text":" Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes is a book based on the film Iron Man 2.","id":"T_AABCD22F14B988D735BC75CDB4893478","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes : Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes : Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_AABCD22F14B988D735BC75CDB4893478/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2_ Iron Man's Friends and Foes-33853.html","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes : Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes : Iron Man 2: Iron Man's Friends and Foes","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34078890.xml","DOCNO":"AABCD22F14B988D7518F53680C679090","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_AABCD22F14B988D7518F53680C679090"}},{"value":"0.015409644693136215","text":" Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash is a book based on the film of the same name.","id":"T_AE77BBE34C556A8CA25014D1B7CE09FC","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash : Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash : Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_AE77BBE34C556A8CA25014D1B7CE09FC/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2_ Iron Man vs. Whiplash-33849.html","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash : Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash : Iron Man 2: Iron Man vs. Whiplash","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34078923.xml","DOCNO":"AE77BBE34C556A8C342BCCA742604000","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_AE77BBE34C556A8C342BCCA742604000"}},{"value":"0.015286149457097054","text":" Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back is a book based on the film of the same name.","id":"T_59264F478D79D41A4FFC5EFD2CB9BAE0","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back : Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back : Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_59264F478D79D41A4FFC5EFD2CB9BAE0/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2_ Iron Man Fights Back-33848.html","title":"Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back : Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back : Iron Man 2: Iron Man Fights Back","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34078918.xml","DOCNO":"59264F478D79D41A7EA3F9559FA91058","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_59264F478D79D41A7EA3F9559FA91058"}},{"value":"0.01510749850422144","text":" Iron Man 2 is a 2010 superhero film based on the superhero Iron Man.

However, an EMP bomb is dropped, disabling Iron Man. Three hours earlier, Tony Stark records a journal message about how he will have to defend the Dataspine. He mentions the Roxxon Energy Corporation, and how they tried to duplicate the Iron Man armour without success. Tony is then interrupted by James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes, who says that there is trouble at Stark Archives. Back in the present, the power reserves in Iron Man's armor activate, and upon recovering, Iron Man learns that Roxxon is behind the attack. He grimly decides that he should destroy the Dataspine to keep Roxxon from getting the archives. Outside, Rhodey, in his War Machine armor, intercepts some Roxxon Dropships. Iron Man makes contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who informs him that separatists under the command of a General Shatalov have seized control of a Tesla facility. During Iron Man's escorting of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s helicopter forces, they are attacked by a battle platform called the Roxxon Armiger. After destroying it, Iron Man and War Machine head to a battlecruiser and destroy it, learning the Armiger was remote-controlled. They discover that Shatalov is working with the terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics to create the Crimson Dynamo suit for him. Upon learning that the suit is being developed at a power plant in Siberia, Fury mentions that he sent Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow, to spy on the plant. At the plant, Shatalov makes contact with A.I.M.'s Kearson DeWitt, who tells Shatalov that there is a spy in his ranks and is displeased that he brought S.H.I.E.L.D. to their front door. Shatalov gives orders to prep the Crimson Dynamo armor and then informs his men that their connection with A.I.M. is now severed. Iron Man finds and protects Natasha from Shatalov's men. A S.H.I.E.L.D. transport is sent to their location, and Natasha is extracted while Iron Man and War Machine battle Shatalov in his Crimson Dynamo armor. The defeated Shatalov reveals that A.I.M. was behind the theft of J.A.R.V.I.S.' AI and planned to use it to create Ultimo. The team learns that Kearson DeWitt was behind the attack led by Shatalov and that he worked at Stark's Theoretical Weapons Division until Stark shut it down. Aside from DeWitt working on the prototype to the Arc Reactor, Pepper Potts also reveals that he had a secret project called P.R.O.T.E.A.N. Inside an A.I.M. base, Kearson uses his PROTEAN technology to merge with an enormous metal suit and become Ultimo. With the merge complete, DeWitt has his men upgraded with P.R.O.T.E.A.N. implants. Arriving at the base, War Machine battles P.R.O.T.E.A.N. drones while Iron Man searches for DeWitt. J.A.R.V.I.S. detects Ultimo shortly after the base is secured with help from S.H.I.E.L.D. Meanwhile, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is attacked, and Iron Man protects it from DeWitt's drones. When War Machine defeats an Arc Armiger dropped on the helicarrier, Iron Man decides to reprogram it. Using the reprogrammed Armiger, Iron Man and War Machine assault an A.I.M. base in Malaysia. When the giant Ultimo arrives, War Machine disables some of its arc reactors while Iron Man fights the DeWitt/Ultimo within. Upon defeating the DeWitt/Ultimo, Iron Man learns that the effects on DeWitt are irreversible. War Machine finishes Ultimo off while the Helicarrier rams into it. Afterward, J.A.R.V.I.S. tells Stark to promise him never to let anyone gain access to his programming again.","id":"T_CEF86BF30F64D94CEC4FD9E6A857A444","title":"Iron Man 2 (video game) : Iron Man 2 (video game) : Plot","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_CEF86BF30F64D94CEC4FD9E6A857A444/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2 (video game)-4306.html","title":"Iron Man 2 (video game) : Iron Man 2 (video game) : Plot","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34078989.xml","DOCNO":"CEF86BF30F64D94CBEC7EC72592C8175","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_CEF86BF30F64D94CBEC7EC72592C8175"}},{"value":"0.008633785881102085","text":"In the Kunar province in Afghanistan a small military convoy is escorting Tony Stark to the airport after testing the Jericho missiles.

General Ross tries to control what is happening and Iron Man enters the area. Iron Man then saves the airman and takes out the Congolese soldiers. The Congolese soldiers are also found to be wearing red clothing with the Ten Rings image on them. Receiving a call from Ross, Iron Man is told to deliver the pilot in Cairo. Three hours later, Iron Man reaches Cairo and delivers the airman to the medics. Ross angrily reprimands him for not returning fire against the Congolese soldiers, however, Iron Man replies that attacking soldiers is what the Army wanted him to do if Hammer failed. Ross then tells him that although he distanced from his father's legacy of creating weapons, Iron Man is a weapon. However, Iron Man then brings out Ross's military resume. Iron Man then states that if an innocent is hurt just to advance a military propaganda, there will be consequences. He then leaves. Later, Stark has a party to which Rhodes and Potts attend. Pepper tells Tony that General Tuner and the joint chiefs are not happy with his actions. However, Tony says that this is what he does now.

Although Vanko is worried, Howard Stark is resolute of everything working out perfectly. In the present day Tony Stark is using the Iron Man armor to have some fun with a group of girls in a yacht. Stark has been recently basking in the spotlight because of his exploits as Iron Man. While Tony enters his limo, a mysterious group in a van watches him. Attending to a party, Tony Stark meets with Pepper Potts, who tells him to meet with James Rhodes at home. Meeting up with Rhodes, who is now a lieutenant colonel, Tony discusses with him about his new life as Iron Man. Rhodes says that ever since he revealed that he was Iron Man, he has been getting people nervous with his reckless attitude. He presses the need of Iron Man working with the U.S. Army, due that Stark always gets to emergencies before the Army officially deploys him. In that moment, Tony and Rhodes receive news from the Army. The Army wants Iron Man to do some reconnaissance in Al-Kut. However, Stark decides to fully enter the emergency as he suits up. Iron Man intercepts a group of insurgents attacking United Nations peacekeeping troops. Iron Man defeats them and meets a film-making crew who recorded everything. He tells them that it was through them that he found out what was going on. He then leaves, but not before telling them not to call him \"Stark\" in their news report, as he is trying to build a brand for Iron Man. Watching the events from the news, Senator Stern discusses with Rhodes about Iron Man's unpredictable nature. Rhodes defends Stark, but Stern introduces him to General Thaddeus Ross. Ross states that they want him as a \"superhuman watchdog\" and the Army can't afford Tony Stark to smarten up, so he has begun a project that will send a message to all enemies of freedom: that they don't need Tony Stark. Ross then shows Rhodes and Stern the construction of a top-secret vehicle.","id":"T_45E234A7973B5B1D7BCCB2E370DCA2FB","title":"Iron Man 2: Public Identity : Iron Man 2: Public Identity : Part 1: 'No Reason'","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_45E234A7973B5B1D7BCCB2E370DCA2FB/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2_ Public Identity-3966.html","title":"Iron Man 2: Public Identity : Iron Man 2: Public Identity : Part 1: 'No Reason'","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34079050.xml","DOCNO":"45E234A7973B5B1DF413F39651BADFB3","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_45E234A7973B5B1DF413F39651BADFB3"}},{"value":"0.007518996484577656","text":" Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron is a comic book sponsored by Audi and released in early 2011.","id":"T_A6B80A264804D2F55F4BE11E8DE8E6F","title":"Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron : Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron : Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_A6B80A264804D2F55F4BE11E8DE8E6F/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man 2_ Fist of Iron-3963.html","title":"Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron : Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron : Iron Man 2: Fist of Iron","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34078911.xml","DOCNO":"A6B80A264804D2F8C76AD924A3B774A","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_A6B80A264804D2F8C76AD924A3B774A"}},{"value":"0.007409235928207636","text":" Creator Tony Stark Made 2011 Users Tony Stark Movie Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3 Web series WHiH Newsfront, *May 3, 2016 (picture) Comic The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week, The Avengers: The Avengers Initiative, The Avengers: Iron Man Mark VII, The Avengers Adaptation, Iron Man 3 Prelude, Captain America: Civil War Prelude Game Iron Man 2, Iron Man 3 - The Official Game, Lego Marvel's Avengers Status Destroyed Preceded by Succeeded by Mark V Mark VII","id":"T_94E4604299EF38D4C30F73B616A1A433","title":"Iron Man Armor: Mark VI : Iron Man Armor: Mark VI : Infobox Iron Man Armor: Mark VI:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_94E4604299EF38D4C30F73B616A1A433/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Iron Man Armor_ Mark VI-3578.html","title":"Iron Man Armor: Mark VI : Iron Man Armor: Mark VI : Infobox Iron Man Armor: Mark VI:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34079338.xml","DOCNO":"94E4604299EF38D490E2C4C1834AFC51","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_94E4604299EF38D490E2C4C1834AFC51"}},{"value":"0.007394310552626848","text":" Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada Writers Paul Tobin Artists Patrick Olliffe, Scott Koblish, Khoi Pham, Clayton Cowles, Chris Sotomayor Release Date February 01, 2011 Number of Comics 1 ?

Iron Man and Captain America continued to argue about the Sokovia Accords until they reached their breaking point. Spider-Man was surprised by Ant-Man at first, who managed to sneak atop the shield and strike Spider-Man in order to return the shield to Captain America. As the former teammates began to fight, Spider-Man asked Iron Man what to do. He told Spider-Man to keep his distance and webbed Captain America and his companions up, as Stark did not want to hurt any of them. He then followed Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Spider-Man chased Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the airport terminal building by crawling along the outside windows. He then smashed through the glass panel and with one kick Spider-Man smashed Falcon to the ground and then turned his attention to the Winter Soldier. While stopping a punch from Winter Soldier, Spider-Man became distracted and amused by his metal arm. During a quick battle with Falcon, he webbed him to some hand railings in the terminal building but again became distracted, this time by Falcon's wings asking him if they were made from carbon fiber. Soon after, the Winter Soldier tried to intervene but Spider-Man was able to web him and Falcon up. However, the hero was soon snatched away by Redwing. Afterward, he rejoined his fellow teammates and he fought with Captain America, who both had a mutual respect towards each other, and managed to give him a good fight but eventually lost. When Captain America forced him to hold up a platform, to which he was impressed by Spider-Man's strength; he then casually asked Spider-Man where he was from before escaping. During the battle, War Machine was thrown through the air by a giant Ant-Man and was about to smash into an aircraft parked outside the airport, but fortunately Spider-Man saved him by firing a web line at War Machine and pulling him away from the aircraft just in the nick of time. At the end of the battle, Spider-Man, inspired by the movie The Empire Strikes Back, came up with a strategy to defeat a gigantic Ant-Man. He webbed up his knees so that Ant-Man lost his stand, and then let Iron Man and War Machine hit him against the helmet with full speed. Ant-Man fell over, hitting Parker, making him fly into a pile of wooden boxes; knocking him unconscious for a short while. After the battle, Iron Man quickly checked to see if he was alright and told the exhausted Parker that he was done and should go home threatening to call his Aunt May if he didn't.

He attempted to calm Hulk down through conversation but inadvertently enraged him by referring to him as Bruce Banner. Hulk then threw a car at Iron Man but Iron Man managed to catch it. Hulk hit him through the car and sent him backwards, so Iron Man took off and grabbed Hulk by the neck, dragging him through the street. Hulk kicked the Hulkbuster armor, freeing himself and crashing Iron Man. When Iron Man rose, Hulk ran at him but the Hulkbuster easily threw him off with the left arm before blasting him with the repulsor cannon on its right, making Hulk hit the side of a building first and then a delivery truck. Iron Man approached the truck but Hulk hit him from behind with a metal pole. He then pounced on the Hulkbuster before Iron Man could recover and severely damaged its left arm but as Hulk tore through the thick armor, Iron Man reversed the damaged arm and punched him off. Hulk recovered almost instantly and charged at Iron Man. Seeing that the left arm of the suit was too damaged, Iron Man ejected it and called the hovering \"Veronica\" carrier for a replacement. He continuously barraged the charging Hulk with Repulsor Blasts from his right arm while the replacement attached itself to the Hulkbuster. Finally, Hulk punched Iron Man but he punched back with his new arm, causing a shockwave. Iron Man managed to throw Hulk down on the ground and proceeded to pound him repeatedly with the new arm. Hulk grabbed hold of the arm but it turned out to be a trap, imprisoning Hulk's hand. Iron Man then attempted to fly Hulk away from the city, but Hulk punched him mid-air, causing him to crash into a building full of people. Iron Man tried to sedate Hulk but Hulk kicked him into an elevator full of people. He grabbed the elevator wire before it crashed, allowing the people to escape. Hulk jumped on him but the Hulkbuster flip-kicked him away before smashing him with the elevator and punching him full in the face, making him lose a tooth. Hulk angrily spit out the tooth, scaring Iron Man enough to apologize. The fight spilled out once again, with Hulk angrily gliding the Hulkbuster across a tall building before ripping out vital components off of it. Veronica attempted to replace the damaged parts but Hulk smashed the incoming replacement right into the carrier, destroying both. Seeking to end the fight quickly, Iron Man flew high above the city, throwing Hulk into a building under construction, shooting missiles to destabilize it and ramming Hulk all the way to the ground floor, burying them both under the rubble. Hulk burst through the rubble and began to calm down as the South African Army arrived on the scene.

Captain America jogs out onto the runway towards a helicopter, which is then quickly disabled by Iron Man as he, War Machine, Black Panther and Black Widow approach Captain America. Captain America attempts to convince them that Barnes is innocent, however Iron Man grows inpatient and orders Spider-Man to web Captain America's hands and steal his shield. Falcon soon locates the Quinjet and notifies Captain America, who then gives the signal to Hawkeye. Hawkeye fires an arrow at the webbing, freeing Captain America as Ant-Man reveals himself to be hiding on Captain America's shield and manages to take Spider-Man by surprise, hitting him and retaking the shield. Stark turns around to the source of the arrow, locating Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch via scan as War Machine announces Falcon and Barnes position and the battle begins. Spider-Man, still inexperienced, asks Iron Man what he should do, who repeats that he should keep his distance and shoot web to harmlessly subdue them. Black Panther immediately heads for Barnes' location but is quickly stopped by Captain America, refusing to let him kill his friend. Ant-Man casually and naively tells Black Widow he'd rather not hurt her, Romanoff responds by kicking him and spinning him around. Ant-Man quickly reacts by shrinking and flipping her over, however Black Widow zaps and launches him away with her bite. Spider-Man smashes through the airport's terminal window and kicks Falcon down and effortlessly intercepts a punch from The Winter Soldier's prosthetic arm, revealing his superhuman strength. Spider-Man becomes distracted at the arm until he is tackled by an airborne Falcon, who carries him up into the air. Meanwhile, the fight between Captain America and Black Panther continues, Rogers struggling to hold back both Black Panther as well as War Machine, who takes hold of his War Hammer to joins in on the fight. Black Panther causes a notible claw mark on Captain America's shield using his vibranium claws. As this occurs, Iron Man catches up to Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, firing missiles around them to force them to stop running. After a brief conversation, Hawkeye distracts Iron Man by purposefully missing arrow shots who allows Scarlet Witch to drop cars from above on top of Iron Man, temporarily immobilizing him. Back in the terminal, Spider-Man chases Falcon through the room before using his spider-sense to quickly dodge a heavy object thrown from behind him by The Winter Soldier, throwing it back in his direction. Falcon tackles Spider-Man a second time, but maneuvers above him and disables his thrusters with web, causing him to fall to the ground and smash through a stand. Spider-Man quickly webs Falcon's arms to a glass barrier before he can escape and goes on to ask if Falcon's wings are made of carbon fibre. Falcon reminds him that you usually don't have conversations while fighting and Spider-Man responds by swinging towards him in an attempt to kick in in the chest. Barnes quickly runs in front of Falcon to absorb the hit, but both still fall through the glass barrier and onto the floor below before being webbed again by Spider-Man. Before Spider-Man can fully immobilize the two of them with more web, Falcon quietly orders Red Wing to grab his arm and throw him out of the window. Barnes murmurs that he should have done that sooner, to which Falcon replies that he hates him. Outside the terminal, Captain America kicks War Machine, destroying his War Hammer. Ant-Man joins Captain America and gives him a shrunken down truck filled with fuel, telling him to throw it at one of his blue pym particles disks. Ant-Man throws the disk in the air and Captain America does as he was instructed, the truck grows to its regular size, blowing up and slamming into War Machine shortly afterwards. The two run off and regroup with Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Falcon and Barnes as they sprint to the Quinjet. Before they can reach it, Vision arrives at the airport and stops them by firing a warning beam across the floor. Vision uses this time to give Captain America one last chance to surrender, while also giving Iron Man's faction enough time to regroup as well. Captain America refuses to surrender, and begins to charge alongside his faction. Iron Man, also refusing to back down, does the same. The two sides slowly build up speed before they all clash together in combat, eventually splintering off into individual fights. Among all the other chaos, Black Widow and Hawkeye exchange hits as Black Widow jokingly asks if they're still friends to which Hawkeye responds that it depends on how hard she hits him. Black Widow flips the distracted archer and almost deals a finishing blow to the head before Scarlet Witch intercepts it and throws her a distance into some airport equipment, hurting her and keeping her out of the majority of the battle from that point. Scarlet Witch scolds Hawkeye for pulling his punches before leaving to help The Winter Soldier. Black Panther had immediately began fighting Bucky and refused to listen to anything he said in his own defense. Before Black Panther gets the chance to claw Barnes' neck, Scarlet Witch stops him and throws him away. Captain America throws his shield and cuts through Spider-Man's webbing as he is swinging around, dropping him to the floor. Spider-Man is once again interested by Captain America's faction's equipment and complains that his shield doesn't obey the laws of physics. Captain America tells Spider-Man that he doesn't understand what's going on, Spider-Man remarks that Stark said he'd say that and begins to follow advice given by Stark on how to beat Captain America. However, despite the advice from Iron Man and Spider-Man's superior abilities, Captain America still comes out on top due to his experience, dropping a plane bridge on top of Spider-Man to temporarily immobilize him. Meanwhile, Falcon requests help from Hawkeye to get Iron Man off his back. Ant-Man climbs onto Hawkeye's arrow and is launched alongside it, the arrow splinters into several pieces to distract Iron Man as Ant-Man leaps from the arrow, runs up an unsuspecting Iron Man's arm and slides into a crack in his armor. Iron Man, now fighting Hawkeye, begins to have several of his suit's weapons systems go offline. Ant-Man makes his presence inside the suit known as he jokes that Stark will need to bring his suit into the shop, which backfires as F.R.I.D.A.Y. begins deploy the suit's fire supression system, launching him out of the suit before he can cause further damage. Captain America and Barnes regroup, Barnes reminding Rogers that Zemo had likely entered Siberia at that point and that they needed to move quickly. Captain America offers to distract Vision as The Winter Soldier takes the Quinjet and goes alone, however Falcon, currently being chased by War Machine, tells Captain America that this wasn't the real fight and that he needed to be there for the real one. Hawkeye chimes in, telling Rogers that if they want to win, some of them will have to lose. Falcon explains that they'll need a big diversion if they want to be able to let both Captain America and Barnes escape in the Quinjet, to which Ant-Man responds that he has something 'big'. He tells Captain America to run at his signal, as he jumps onto War Machine's leg and becomes Giant-Man, increasing his size to several stories high and capturing the attention of everyone. He grabs War Machine and throws him across the airport, Spider-Man barely catching him with a string of web before he crashes into a plane. As Giant-Man, Lang begins to kick and throw large objects towards Iron Man's faction, not limited to a plane wing thrown at Iron Man during his fight with Falcon and a bus kicked towards Black Panther (who is narrowly protected by Vision, who blocks the bus just in time) as he attempts to chase The Winter Soldier. Iron Man asks if anyone on his team had any abilities they wanted to disclose before Falcon temporarily closes his wings midflight and launches Red Wing into Iron Man's head, destroying it in the process. Black Panther is blocked by Giant-Man once again in his attempt to reach Barnes, who kicks him over and is in the process of kneeling down to grab him as he peppered with non-lethal rounds from War Machine, who is carrying Spider-Man. Spider-Man leaps from War Machine onto Giant-Man, swinging around his arm before kicking him in the face. Below, Hawkeye introduces himself to Black Panther after firing multiple arrows at him, to which Black Panther responds that he doesn't care. The two engage in hand to hand combat as War Machine continues to attack Giant-Man, eventually firing his full arsenal at him as he attempts to crush War Machine with a bus. Vision, after attacking Lang, becomes aware of Captain America and Barnes' escape, and decides to destroy the tower next to the Quinjet's hanger to block the entrance. Scarlet Witch quickly uses her powers to slow down the fall of the debris, until War Machine uses his Stark Sonic Cannon to release a high frequency that incapacitates her. Rogers and Barnes are forced to slide under the debris as it falls, who are greeted by Black Widow as they finally reach the Quinjet. Black Widow comes to terms with the fact that Rogers isn't going to change his mind, and decides to help him by betraying her side by once again using her bite, this time on Black Panther, who had since ended his fight with Hawkeye and given chase. As the rest of Iron Man's faction are still in the process of fighting Giant-Man, Spider-Man comes up with the idea to lock his legs together similar to the way AT-ATs were beaten in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Lang, slowed down in Giant-Man form, is unable to respond to Spider-Man spinning around his legs tying him up with web as Iron Man and War Machine team up and punch Giant-Man in the head, knocking him down and taking him out of the fight for good (not without accidentally knocking Parker as he fell, however). Stark lands to see if Spider-Man is okay and orders him to go home in case he gets hurt again, thanking him for the job he did. Piloting the Quinjet, Captain America finishes shooting down the debris in the way of the hanger entrance before leaving, despite Black Panther's best efforts to stop him. Vision flies over to a recovering Scarlet Witch and they apologize to each other for fighting. War Machine and Iron Man begin following the Quinjet, with Falcon not far behind. Falcon begins peppering Rhodes with missiles and Rhodes responds by requesting Vision to disable Falcon's thrusters so he would be forced to safely glide down to the ground. Vision, distracted, fires an abnormally powerful beam at Falcon who quickly dodges it. The beam continues through the air and cuts through War Machine's suit, destroying its arc-reactor and completely disabling the suit. Rhodes, trapped inside the suit and unable to control it, begins to plummet to the earth. Both Falcon and Iron Man stop chasing the Quinjet and fly down in an effort to save Rhodes, but neither are fast enough and he slams into the ground. Tony lands and tears off the helmet's mask, revealing Rhodes to be unconscious. F.R.I.D.A.Y. reads his vitals and informs Stark that he is still alive. Wilson lands and tells Stark that he is sorry. Stark, distraught, blasts Falcon in the chest, signalling the end of the conflict.","id":"T_BBCF7CC9BE63E2285034F4D0E78B0DE9","title":"Clash of the Avengers : Clash of the Avengers : Battle","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_BBCF7CC9BE63E2285034F4D0E78B0DE9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Clash of the Avengers-156427.html","title":"Clash of the Avengers : Clash of the Avengers : Battle","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34068869.xml","DOCNO":"BBCF7CC9BE63E228902156E4404D4240","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_BBCF7CC9BE63E228902156E4404D4240"}},{"value":"0.003200588747859001","text":" Founder Howard Stark , Chester Phillips , Peggy Carter Leader Unknown Former leaders Phil Coulson, Alphonso Mackenzie (acting director), Robert Gonzales (separate faction, until merge), Nick Fury, Alexander Pierce , Peggy Carter , Howard Stark , Chester Phillips Notable members Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Billy Koenig, Sam Koenig, Alphonso Mackenzie, Anne Weaver, Elena Rodriguez, Mike Peterson Notable former members Peggy Carter , Howard Stark , Mitchell Carson, Hank Pym, Janet van Dyne, Alexander Pierce , Jasper Sitwell , Nick Fury, Brock Rumlow , Natasha Romanoff, Clint Barton, Steve Rogers, Maria Hill, Victoria Hand , John Garrett , Grant Ward , Antoine Triplett , Sharon Carter, Robert Gonzales , Felix Blake (defected), Isabelle Hartley , Idaho , Agent 33 , Bobbi Morse, Lance Hunter, Wolfgang von Strucker , List , Arnim Zola , Joey Gutierrez, Lincoln Campbell , Daisy Johnson Vehicles Helicarrier, Quinjet, Bus (formerly, destroyed), S.H.I.E.L.D.

While the battle goes on, Hawkeye then got in a fight with his best friend Black Widow. Their fight was an equal one as they are both equally skilled in combat. As Hawkeye threw Black Widow to the ground, she questioned if they are still friends, which Hawkeye jokingly said it depended on how hard she hit him. Black Widow got the upper hand as Hawkeye was holding back as he did not want to hurt his best friend. Black Widow was about to kick Barton in the face, but, was stopped by Scarlet Witch who threw her away with her powers. Scarlet Witch picked up on Hawkeye pulling his punches and she continued to fight. As the battle between the Avengers continued, Hawkeye continued to fight and held his own against Iron Man's team. Falcon was being attacked by Iron Man and called Hawkeye to get Iron Man off him. Hawkeye then teamed up with Ant-Man, by getting him on one of his Jericho arrows. Hawkeye asked if he was buckled in and fired Ant-Man at Iron Man so he could disable Iron Man's armor. The arrow broke apart into several small arrows and flew at Iron Man, who destroyed all the incoming arrows. Ant-Man managed to jump off the arrow before it was destroyed. While Ant-Man was disabling Iron Man's armor, Hawkeye fought Iron Man to distract him while Ant-Man disabled his armor. Right when Iron Man went to fire back at Hawkeye, his armor started to malfunction and Hawkeye made his way to his next fight.","id":"T_BF593E9CD9D6E19216D1E9E239052236","title":"Hawkeye : Hawkeye : Fighting Former Comrades","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_BF593E9CD9D6E19216D1E9E239052236/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Hawkeye-2081.html","title":"Hawkeye : Hawkeye : Fighting Former Comrades","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34076725.xml","DOCNO":"BF593E9CD9D6E1929F11B1184CC86380","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_BF593E9CD9D6E1929F11B1184CC86380"}},{"value":"0.003186676884070039","text":" Location Earth Interest Afghanistan, Armenia, Bahrain, Burma, Cambodia, China, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran , Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Yemen Notable inhabitants Wu, Quan Chen, Chan Ho Yin, Miles Lydon, Raina Population Asians Movie Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (mentioned), Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil Comic Iron Man: Fast Friends (mentioned), Iron Man: I Am Iron Man!, Iron Man 2: Public Identity, Iron Man 2: Nick Fury: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week (mentioned), The Avengers: Black Widow Strikes, The Avengers: The Avengers Initiative, Iron Man 3 Prelude","id":"T_6F21B3C7D6D2114ACC36561ADEB8C16C","title":"Asia : Asia : Infobox Asia:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_6F21B3C7D6D2114ACC36561ADEB8C16C/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Asia-6657.html","title":"Asia : Asia : Infobox Asia:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34063629.xml","DOCNO":"6F21B3C7D6D2114ACE51F60F068EF373","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_6F21B3C7D6D2114ACE51F60F068EF373"}}],"synonymList":[{"partOfSpeech":"verb","value":"is","lemma":"be","synSet":[{"name":"Lemma_Expansion","synonym":[{"isChosen":true,"value":"be","weight":1.0}]}]},{"partOfSpeech":"noun","value":"Iron","lemma":"iron","synSet":[{"name":"Wordnet_iron-noun-1","synonym":[{"isChosen":true,"value":"fe","weight":1.0}]}]}],"disambiguatedEntityList":[],"pipelineid":"206721060","formattedAnswer":false,"category":"","items":5,"status":"Complete","id":"22EFF3FB06C143C3A5CB8695C8CCF8FA","questionText":"Who is Iron-Man?","evidenceRequest":{"items":-1,"profile":"NO"},"answers":[{"id":0,"text":"5DDAF7D2C34E186951954E3919E458B0 - Iron Man: I Am Iron Man! : Iron Man: I Am Iron Man! : Iron Man: I Am Iron Man!","pipeline":"Descriptive,TAO","confidence":0.10099,"entityTypeList":[]},{"id":1,"text":"5697878629180829C84AD38BD7177193 - Iron Man: I Am Iron Man!
