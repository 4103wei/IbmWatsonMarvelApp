Though Marvel Studios looked at over 1500 actors for the role of Spider-Man, including Nat Wolff, Timothee Chalamet, Liam James and Chandler Riggs, the shortlist was reduced to six contenders: Tom Holland, Asa Butterfield, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer and Charlie Rowe.

Peggy Carter learned of the assignment to infiltrate his business and went to confront him on her own. Raymond gave a packet of money to a man who refused to speak; Raymond decided that, pleasantries aside, business was business and made the transaction, placing the Nitramene bomb within his safe. Carter, using her beauty to get pass a bouncer, approached Raymond's office after she applied her lipstick. Raymond allowed Carter entry, but when she asked him about the Nitramene, he feigned ignorance. Seducing him, Carter got Raymond to admit to accepting the formula. However, when he abruptly kissed her, he was made unconscious. When he awakened, he found his safe open. Raymond moaned loudly as he found the nitramene bomb gone. The man in the Green Suit entered his office and Raymond attempted to explain that he could find the device and fix the situation; the man shot and killed Raymond. SSR agents Yauch, Jack Thompson, and Ray Krzeminski stormed into Raymond's office and found him dead on the floor, commenting that they should not have taken so long in changing their clothes. As Green Suit hunted for Leet Brannis, he was told that Raymond dealt with Gino DeLucia to try to sell the Nitramene.","id":"T_12D02DBD9AD439C58D39BEEE2B68EE4C","title":"Spider Raymond : Spider Raymond : Biography","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_12D02DBD9AD439C58D39BEEE2B68EE4C/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider Raymond-61162.html","title":"Spider Raymond : Spider Raymond : Biography","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096021.xml","DOCNO":"12D02DBD9AD439C5E2B0189B4E5DB657","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_12D02DBD9AD439C5E2B0189B4E5DB657"}},{"value":"0.007854594849050045","text":" Peggy Carter.

It is the first major film franchise to cross the $9 billion and $10 billion marks. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is the highest-grossing franchise of all time. Due to financial difficulties Marvel faced in the past, they had to sell the film rights to several of their comic book characters. Some of these sales are still in effect today, and thus the characters cannot be used in the MCU. Due to Fox owning the rights to the X-Men franchise, the X-Men films take place in a different universe to the MCU. Fox also owns the rights to the Fantastic Four film franchises. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch fall under both companies rights, as they are mutants by origin but are heavily associated with The Avengers. Both companies have certain limitations however. Fox cannot make any reference to the Twins' involvement with the Avengers. Marvel cannot make any reference to the Twins being mutants, the children of Magneto, or their association with the X-Men. Similarly, Spider-Man's film rights are owned by Sony, and both the Sam Raimi series and The Amazing Spider-Man series were set separate from the MCU; although after the last movie in the latter franchise, a deal was made between the two companies, resulting in another reboot of the series, this time making it set in the MCU. The initial indication of an element of cooperation between Sony and Disney was when Sony gave permission for Disney to use the OsCorp Building for a background cameo in The Avengers; however, due to budget and time constraints the idea was abandoned. Furthermore, Andrew Garfield, the actor who played Spider-Man in the Amazing Spider-Man series, had expressed interest in appearing in an Avengers sequel. On February 10th 2015, it was announced that Sony and Disney had struck a deal for setting Spider-Man in the MCU. The character, played by Tom Holland, is set to make his first appearance in the MCU in Captain America: Civil War followed by the second reboot of the franchise, a solo film titled Spider-Man: Homecoming which is set to release in 2017. Additionally, it was announced that Sony would have full creative control over the character and the franchise whilst setting it in the MCU, allowing characters from other MCU properties to appear in it and vice-versa. Additionally, the planned spin-offs to the franchise by Sony are also reportedly in development, but has since abandoned after The Amazing Spider-Man 3's cancellation. The cinematic rights to Namor lie with Marvel Studios currently but due to 'older contracts with other parties' it seems they couldn't use them yet. As of June 2016, the films rights to Namor now lies with Marvel Studios, and can now be used for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematic rights to Man-Thing lie with Marvel Studios, while they originally used to lie with Lionsgate and thus he couldn't be used in the MCU at that time. After the release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios made a deal to produce five further movies with Paramount Pictures - Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers and Iron Man 3. In 2009, Disney purchased Marvel and gained the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3. In 2013, they gained the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to close the acquisition of Marvel.The Incredible Hulk is the only MCU film not currently owned by Disney due to a separate agreement between Marvel and Universal Studios. A recurring theme in the solo movies is that the main protagonist often isn't the one who defeats the main antagonist, or needs help from an ally to do so. Iron Monger and Aldrich Killian were killed by Pepper Potts, and War Machine helped Iron Man defeat Whiplash, who ends up committing suicide. Thor's fight with Loki was interrupted by Odin, and Malekith was killed by Erik Selvig. Red Skull was vanished by the Tesseract, Nick Fury shot Alexander Pierce, and Captain America's fight with Winter Soldier ended as a stalemate. Hulk and Ant-Man are currently the only exceptions, as they defeated Abomination and Yellowjacket respectively by themselves.","id":"T_575E9BCCF3CD245D165FB1C52A5E88D6","title":"Marvel Cinematic Universe : Marvel Cinematic Universe : Trivia","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_575E9BCCF3CD245D165FB1C52A5E88D6/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Marvel Cinematic Universe-2027.html","title":"Marvel Cinematic Universe : Marvel Cinematic Universe : Trivia","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34085722.xml","DOCNO":"575E9BCCF3CD245DE2074BB5B5DEA951","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_575E9BCCF3CD245DE2074BB5B5DEA951"}},{"value":"0.004835565108805895","text":" In the afternoon in Germany, Helmut Zemo moves forward with his plan, boarding a flight to Moscow. Arriving in Germany, Clint Barton puts Scott Lang in the back of a van as him and Maximoff drive to meet Rogers at the Flughafen Leipzig-Halle airport. On the way, Lang falls asleep in the van. Sharon Carter drives Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes to the Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, managing to smuggle Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon suit out of the Joint Counter Terrorist Center to return them to their owners. Rogers thanks Carter for all her help, and the two share a kiss, which they both agree was long overdue between the two of them. Barton then arrives with Maximoff and Lang, and when he wakes up Lang, he is very awestruck to meet his hero, Captain America. Him and Wilson share a joke about the last time they met, and Lang agrees to help them. They then hear that Stark and his team have arrived and shut down the airport, and Rogers tells his team to \"suit up\". Clash of the Avengers: Around 24 hours after Thaddeus Ross gave Stark his 36 hour deadline, Iron Man and his team confront Captain America and some of his team at the airport, bringing in Spider-Man in his new suit to bind Captain America's hands with his webbing and steal his shield. When Rogers refuses to listen to Stark and back down, Ant-Man steals Captain America's Shield back for him, and Hawkeye shoots an arrow to break the webbing binding between Captain America's hands, and a battle breaks out between Iron Man and Captain America's two teams. Iron Man goes to apprehend Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, but the two work together to bring cars crashing down on Stark and keep him trapped temporarily. Meanwhile, Spider-Man swings in to take out Winter Soldier and Falcon, using his super strength to block Barnes' punches, and his webbing to stop Falcon's wings from working. As he fights the two, he continuously spouts witty lines and jokes, something which Falcon picks up on. When it seems like Spider-Man has the two defeated, Falcon uses Redwing to grab Spider-Man and throw him out of the airport window. As everyone escapes the various predicaments they have got themselves into, the twelve heroes all end up coming together in the airplane parking area outside the airport. The six heroes on each side begin to run at each other, and all the heroes pair off, clashing with each other, each in an attempt to subdue and take down the other, but with no one having the desire to kill anyone else. In the process, Black Panther gets in a hand-to-hand fight with Barnes, who tells him that he did not kill his father, but T'Challa does not believe him. A massive battle unfolds, resulting in the destruction of much of the airport. Rogers and Barnes, however, know they need a way to get to Siberia so as to stop Zemo from reactivating the five Winter Soldiers. They notice Stark's Quinjet parked in a section of the airport, and realize that they are going to need a distraction so as to escape in the jet. Ant-Man volunteers a distraction he has attempted in a laboratory before, using his suit to make himself grow to be giant instead of shrinking. Taking Iron Man's team by surprise, the team work on taking down Ant-Man's new \"Giant-Man\" form and all but momentarily forget about Captain America and the Winter Soldier. After Giant-Man grabs War Machine, Spider-Man wraps his webbing around Giant-Man's legs to make him fall over. Meanwhile, Vision notices Captain America and the Winter Soldier running for the Quinjet, and causes a tower to fall on them to stop them reaching it. Scarlet Witch manages to use her telekinesis to hold up the tower long enough to allow them to reach the jet's hangar. However, they find that Black Widow is waiting for them inside the hangar, and worry that she is about to try to stop them. Instead though, turning against Iron Man's team as she uses her Black Widow's Bite to subdue Black Panther, who had quietly made it into the hangar after the two as well. She allows Rogers and Barnes to escape in the Quinjet, simply telling T'Challa that she said she would help find Rogers, not catch him. As the Quinjet flies away, War Machine and Iron Man fly in pursuit, and Falcon flies after them to help his friends escape. Iron Man gets Vision to try to shoot Falcon's wings to stop him from catching them, but Vision is momentarily distracted by trying to comfort Scarlet Witch and misses the shot he fires from the Mind Stone in his forehead, catching War Machine's arc reactor instead of Falcon's wings, and causing Rhodes to fall uncontrollably from the sky. He crashes to the ground before Iron Man or Falcon can catch him. He survives the fall, but is severely injured, and the Quinjet flies away. Iron Man takes out Falcon in rage, and the authorities soon arrive to arrest Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch and Falcon. Parker soon returns home. Zemo touches down in Moscow and starts traveling up to Siberia.","id":"T_369EAD1423389E9B49622479C1BFFB9","title":"2016 : 2016 : 9th","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_369EAD1423389E9B49622479C1BFFB9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"2016-160153.html","title":"2016 : 2016 : 9th","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34060297.xml","DOCNO":"369EAD1423389E9B7C9AC2A47F6ABA5E","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_369EAD1423389E9B7C9AC2A47F6ABA5E"}},{"value":"0.004783835727721453","text":" On February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures Studios and Marvel Studios announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film and Sony releasing a Spider-Man film co-produced by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on July 28, 2017, with Sony Pictures continuing to own, finance, distribute, and having final creative control of the Spider-Man films. In April 2015, Feige revealed that Marvel had been working to bring Spider-Man into the MCU since at least October 2014, when they announced their full slate of Phase Three films, saying, \"Marvel doesn't announce anything officially until it's set in stone.

Partnering with Lions Gate Entertainment in 2004, Marvel plans to enter the direct-to-DVD market with eight animated films with Lionsgate handling distribution. Marvel entered into a non-recourse financing structure with Merrill Lynch Commercial Finance Corp. that is collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel gets $525 million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the deal with Paramount in September 2004. Those properties were: Ant-Man, The Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, Shang-Chi. In 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as President and Chief Operating Officer. In November 2005, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from New Line Cinema. In 2006, Marvel revealed that it has regained the film rights to The Incredible Hulk. April 2006, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to Thor from Sony. That year the film was announced to be a Marvel Studios production. Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the Black Widow motion picture project it had since 2004 giving the rights back to Marvel. In March 2007, David Maisel was named Chairman and Kevin Feige was named President of Production as Iron Man began filming. In 2008, Marvel Studios signed a lease with Raleigh Studios to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four movies on the studios' slate, including Iron Man 2 and Thor, at their Manhattan Beach facilities. In 2009, Marvel attempted to hire a team of writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther, Cable, Iron Fist, Nighthawk, and Vision. On December 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Both Marvel and Disney have stated that the merger would not affect any preexisting deals with other film studios for the time being, although Disney said they would consider distributing future Marvel projects with their own studios once the current deals expired. On October 18, 2010, Disney bought the distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures. In June 2010, Marvel set up a television division headed up by Jeph Loeb as Executive Vice President. Beginning with Thor: The Dark World, the Marvel Studios logo was given a makeover and its own fanfare by composer Brian Tyler. According to Kevin Feige, this was to symbolize Marvel as its own entity within the Walt Disney Company since Thor: The Dark World would be the first movie to only feature the studio's logo without any other. On February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios announced a deal that would introduce Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, allowing Spider-Man characters to appear in Marvel Studios films, as well as Marvel Studios characters in Sony Pictures films. Under this deal, Sony would co-produce the new Spider-Man series with Marvel Studios, while Sony would still finance, own, distribute, and have final creative control over the projects. This set Spider-Man to show up in one Marvel Studios film before his MCU solo-film debut in Spider-Man: Homecoming to be released on July 28, 2017. This was the previous release date of Thor: Ragnarok, since which its release date was pushed back along with Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Inhumans. In August 2015, after the release of Ant-Man, Disney and Marvel underwent a reorganization with Feige no longer reporting to Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, but to Disney Studios CEO Alan F. Horn.","id":"T_DAE2E0CD4F56FF78BC95AAD826DC08BF","title":"Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_DAE2E0CD4F56FF78BC95AAD826DC08BF/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Marvel Studios-2084.html","title":"Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34085841.xml","DOCNO":"DAE2E0CD4F56FF7886A780552232F78F","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_DAE2E0CD4F56FF7886A780552232F78F"}},{"value":"0.004642822779715061","text":" In the comics, the Civil War storyline was centered around superheroes registering their secret identities and the details of their powers and abilities with the government, a plot point that would not work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has largely eschewed the secret identity trope. Kevin Feige has said that this storyline will focus on government regulation of the heroes after the battle in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Peggy Carter's speech that her niece Sharon quoted during her eulogy is the same speech Captain America gave to Spider-Man in Amazing Spider-Man, during the Civil War storyline. In the film both Scott Lang becoming Giant-Man and War Machine getting badly injured are a nod towards the second Giant-Man in the comics Bill Foster who was an Anti-Registration hero in the Civil War who was killed by Thor's clone Ragnarok, who unlike Vision in the film did it on his own accord, rather than by accident. In the Civil War comics, Spider-Man was on the Pro-Registration side until he defected to the Anti-Registration side after learning how they were imprisoning the captured heroes in the Negative Zone without due process until they agreed to register. In the film, after Spider-Man is injured during the battle at the airport in Germany, Iron Man removes him from the team and sends him back home to New York.","id":"T_6C07DD604F963FBC3B60859B54A15923","title":"Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Parallelisms with the Civil War comic book storyline","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_6C07DD604F963FBC3B60859B54A15923/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Captain America_ Civil War_Trivia-47506.html","title":"Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Parallelisms with the Civil War comic book storyline","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34067443.xml","DOCNO":"6C07DD604F963FBCABFA41CC15CB11FC","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_6C07DD604F963FBCABFA41CC15CB11FC"}},{"value":"0.004568028263747692","text":" A-Bomb/Rick Jones.

The others are Bruce Banner, Howard Stark, Thanos and Fandral. In Iron Man 3, Rhodey is known as the Iron Patriot. However in the comics, it was in fact Norman Osborn who wore the Iron Patriot armor but due to Sony owning the film rights to Spider-Man (and everything Spider-Man related) and Norman Osborn also being the Green Goblin, from Spider-Man's rogue gallery, Osborn could not appear in a Marvel Studios film at that time. After the release of Iron Man 3, for a time, the mainstream counterpart of Rhodey has also taken the mantle of Iron Patriot in the comics, before later going back to the War Machine armor. As War Machine, James Rhodes became the first African American superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In an unused draft of Iron Man, Howard Stark featured as still alive, a ruthless businessman and the main villain, who adopted the identity of \"War Machine\". War Machine's legs and spine being damaged are a nod to the comics where James Rhodes suffers injures and is rebuilt as a cyborg, though later received a new body.","id":"T_C2F19C5B1664FF035D2A863D2DB1032E","title":"War Machine : War Machine : Trivia","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_C2F19C5B1664FF035D2A863D2DB1032E/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"War Machine-2058.html","title":"War Machine : War Machine : Trivia","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34101524.xml","DOCNO":"C2F19C5B1664FF0362C81F4F233357A9","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_C2F19C5B1664FF0362C81F4F233357A9"}}],"synonymList":[{"partOfSpeech":"verb","value":"is","lemma":"be","synSet":[{"name":"Lemma_Expansion","synonym":[{"isChosen":true,"value":"be","weight":1.0}]}]}],"disambiguatedEntityList":[],"pipelineid":"863783858","formattedAnswer":false,"category":"","items":5,"status":"Complete","id":"364987410B954D83AEBC352632A61CAE","questionText":"who is Spider-Man?","evidenceRequest":{"items":-1,"profile":"NO"},"answers":[{"id":0,"text":"43DC7B1E0A49E6207002C4F92E226812 - Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Spider-Man","pipeline":"TAO,Descriptive","confidence":0.10015,"entityTypeList":[]},{"id":1,"text":"3445E014DCD78DBCDF024F510322EC48 - Spider-Man: Homecoming : Spider-Man: Homecoming : Spider-Man: Homecoming","pipeline":"Descriptive,TAO","confidence":0.07375,"entityTypeList":[]},{"id":2,"text":"CDA2FFF9EB197B5A6F2E09C137BA3791 - Spider-Man Suit : Spider-Man Suit : Spider-Man Suit","pipeline":"Descriptive,TAO","confidence":0.04079,"entityTypeList":[]},{"id":3,"text":"43DC7B1E0A49E620AD1E405C35986927 - Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Becoming Spider-Man","pipeline":"Descriptive,TAO","confidence":0.04011,"entityTypeList":[]},{"id":4,"text":"B0F686B3D8C132A0F44C1412963F9B80 - Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia","pipeline":"TAO,Descriptive","confidence":0.03311,"entityTypeList":[]}],"errorNotifications":[],"passthru":""}}
