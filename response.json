Logan Lerman and Dylan O'Brien were considered for the role since the announcement in February, 2015. Though Marvel Studios looked at over 1500 actors for the role of Spider-Man, including Nat Wolff, Timothee Chalamet, Liam James and Chandler Riggs, the shortlist was reduced to six contenders: Tom Holland, Asa Butterfield, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer and Charlie Rowe. The film's working title is Summer of George.The Summer of George was the title of the Season 8 finale of Seinfeld.

Captain America jogs out onto the runway towards a helicopter, which is then quickly disabled by Iron Man as he, War Machine, Black Panther and Black Widow approach Captain America. Captain America attempts to convince them that Barnes is innocent, however Iron Man grows inpatient and orders Spider-Man to web Captain America's hands and steal his shield. Falcon soon locates the Quinjet and notifies Captain America, who then gives the signal to Hawkeye. Hawkeye fires an arrow at the webbing, freeing Captain America as Ant-Man reveals himself to be hiding on Captain America's shield and manages to take Spider-Man by surprise, hitting him and retaking the shield. Stark turns around to the source of the arrow, locating Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch via scan as War Machine announces Falcon and Barnes position and the battle begins. Spider-Man, still inexperienced, asks Iron Man what he should do, who repeats that he should keep his distance and shoot web to harmlessly subdue them. Black Panther immediately heads for Barnes' location but is quickly stopped by Captain America, refusing to let him kill his friend. Ant-Man casually and naively tells Black Widow he'd rather not hurt her, Romanoff responds by kicking him and spinning him around. Ant-Man quickly reacts by shrinking and flipping her over, however Black Widow zaps and launches him away with her bite. Spider-Man smashes through the airport's terminal window and kicks Falcon down and effortlessly intercepts a punch from The Winter Soldier's prosthetic arm, revealing his superhuman strength. Spider-Man becomes distracted at the arm until he is tackled by an airborne Falcon, who carries him up into the air. Meanwhile, the fight between Captain America and Black Panther continues, Rogers struggling to hold back both Black Panther as well as War Machine, who takes hold of his War Hammer to joins in on the fight. Black Panther causes a notible claw mark on Captain America's shield using his vibranium claws. As this occurs, Iron Man catches up to Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, firing missiles around them to force them to stop running. After a brief conversation, Hawkeye distracts Iron Man by purposefully missing arrow shots who allows Scarlet Witch to drop cars from above on top of Iron Man, temporarily immobilizing him. Back in the terminal, Spider-Man chases Falcon through the room before using his spider-sense to quickly dodge a heavy object thrown from behind him by The Winter Soldier, throwing it back in his direction. Falcon tackles Spider-Man a second time, but maneuvers above him and disables his thrusters with web, causing him to fall to the ground and smash through a stand. Spider-Man quickly webs Falcon's arms to a glass barrier before he can escape and goes on to ask if Falcon's wings are made of carbon fibre. Falcon reminds him that you usually don't have conversations while fighting and Spider-Man responds by swinging towards him in an attempt to kick in in the chest. Barnes quickly runs in front of Falcon to absorb the hit, but both still fall through the glass barrier and onto the floor below before being webbed again by Spider-Man. Before Spider-Man can fully immobilize the two of them with more web, Falcon quietly orders Red Wing to grab his arm and throw him out of the window. Barnes murmurs that he should have done that sooner, to which Falcon replies that he hates him. Outside the terminal, Captain America kicks War Machine, destroying his War Hammer. Ant-Man joins Captain America and gives him a shrunken down truck filled with fuel, telling him to throw it at one of his blue pym particles disks. Ant-Man throws the disk in the air and Captain America does as he was instructed, the truck grows to its regular size, blowing up and slamming into War Machine shortly afterwards. The two run off and regroup with Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Falcon and Barnes as they sprint to the Quinjet. Before they can reach it, Vision arrives at the airport and stops them by firing a warning beam across the floor. Vision uses this time to give Captain America one last chance to surrender, while also giving Iron Man's faction enough time to regroup as well. Captain America refuses to surrender, and begins to charge alongside his faction. Iron Man, also refusing to back down, does the same. The two sides slowly build up speed before they all clash together in combat, eventually splintering off into individual fights. Among all the other chaos, Black Widow and Hawkeye exchange hits as Black Widow jokingly asks if they're still friends to which Hawkeye responds that it depends on how hard she hits him. Black Widow flips the distracted archer and almost deals a finishing blow to the head before Scarlet Witch intercepts it and throws her a distance into some airport equipment, hurting her and keeping her out of the majority of the battle from that point. Scarlet Witch scolds Hawkeye for pulling his punches before leaving to help The Winter Soldier. Black Panther had immediately began fighting Bucky and refused to listen to anything he said in his own defense. Before Black Panther gets the chance to claw Barnes' neck, Scarlet Witch stops him and throws him away. Captain America throws his shield and cuts through Spider-Man's webbing as he is swinging around, dropping him to the floor. Spider-Man is once again interested by Captain America's faction's equipment and complains that his shield doesn't obey the laws of physics. Captain America tells Spider-Man that he doesn't understand what's going on, Spider-Man remarks that Stark said he'd say that and begins to follow advice given by Stark on how to beat Captain America. However, despite the advice from Iron Man and Spider-Man's superior abilities, Captain America still comes out on top due to his experience, dropping a plane bridge on top of Spider-Man to temporarily immobilize him. Meanwhile, Falcon requests help from Hawkeye to get Iron Man off his back. Ant-Man climbs onto Hawkeye's arrow and is launched alongside it, the arrow splinters into several pieces to distract Iron Man as Ant-Man leaps from the arrow, runs up an unsuspecting Iron Man's arm and slides into a crack in his armor. Iron Man, now fighting Hawkeye, begins to have several of his suit's weapons systems go offline. Ant-Man makes his presence inside the suit known as he jokes that Stark will need to bring his suit into the shop, which backfires as F.R.I.D.A.Y. begins deploy the suit's fire supression system, launching him out of the suit before he can cause further damage. Captain America and Barnes regroup, Barnes reminding Rogers that Zemo had likely entered Siberia at that point and that they needed to move quickly. Captain America offers to distract Vision as The Winter Soldier takes the Quinjet and goes alone, however Falcon, currently being chased by War Machine, tells Captain America that this wasn't the real fight and that he needed to be there for the real one. Hawkeye chimes in, telling Rogers that if they want to win, some of them will have to lose. Falcon explains that they'll need a big diversion if they want to be able to let both Captain America and Barnes escape in the Quinjet, to which Ant-Man responds that he has something 'big'. He tells Captain America to run at his signal, as he jumps onto War Machine's leg and becomes Giant-Man, increasing his size to several stories high and capturing the attention of everyone. He grabs War Machine and throws him across the airport, Spider-Man barely catching him with a string of web before he crashes into a plane. As Giant-Man, Lang begins to kick and throw large objects towards Iron Man's faction, not limited to a plane wing thrown at Iron Man during his fight with Falcon and a bus kicked towards Black Panther (who is narrowly protected by Vision, who blocks the bus just in time) as he attempts to chase The Winter Soldier. Iron Man asks if anyone on his team had any abilities they wanted to disclose before Falcon temporarily closes his wings midflight and launches Red Wing into Iron Man's head, destroying it in the process. Black Panther is blocked by Giant-Man once again in his attempt to reach Barnes, who kicks him over and is in the process of kneeling down to grab him as he peppered with non-lethal rounds from War Machine, who is carrying Spider-Man. Spider-Man leaps from War Machine onto Giant-Man, swinging around his arm before kicking him in the face. Below, Hawkeye introduces himself to Black Panther after firing multiple arrows at him, to which Black Panther responds that he doesn't care. The two engage in hand to hand combat as War Machine continues to attack Giant-Man, eventually firing his full arsenal at him as he attempts to crush War Machine with a bus. Vision, after attacking Lang, becomes aware of Captain America and Barnes' escape, and decides to destroy the tower next to the Quinjet's hanger to block the entrance. Scarlet Witch quickly uses her powers to slow down the fall of the debris, until War Machine uses his Stark Sonic Cannon to release a high frequency that incapacitates her. Rogers and Barnes are forced to slide under the debris as it falls, who are greeted by Black Widow as they finally reach the Quinjet. Black Widow comes to terms with the fact that Rogers isn't going to change his mind, and decides to help him by betraying her side by once again using her bite, this time on Black Panther, who had since ended his fight with Hawkeye and given chase. As the rest of Iron Man's faction are still in the process of fighting Giant-Man, Spider-Man comes up with the idea to lock his legs together similar to the way AT-ATs were beaten in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Lang, slowed down in Giant-Man form, is unable to respond to Spider-Man spinning around his legs tying him up with web as Iron Man and War Machine team up and punch Giant-Man in the head, knocking him down and taking him out of the fight for good (not without accidentally knocking Parker as he fell, however). Stark lands to see if Spider-Man is okay and orders him to go home in case he gets hurt again, thanking him for the job he did. Piloting the Quinjet, Captain America finishes shooting down the debris in the way of the hanger entrance before leaving, despite Black Panther's best efforts to stop him. Vision flies over to a recovering Scarlet Witch and they apologize to each other for fighting. War Machine and Iron Man begin following the Quinjet, with Falcon not far behind. Falcon begins peppering Rhodes with missiles and Rhodes responds by requesting Vision to disable Falcon's thrusters so he would be forced to safely glide down to the ground. Vision, distracted, fires an abnormally powerful beam at Falcon who quickly dodges it. The beam continues through the air and cuts through War Machine's suit, destroying its arc-reactor and completely disabling the suit. Rhodes, trapped inside the suit and unable to control it, begins to plummet to the earth. Both Falcon and Iron Man stop chasing the Quinjet and fly down in an effort to save Rhodes, but neither are fast enough and he slams into the ground. Tony lands and tears off the helmet's mask, revealing Rhodes to be unconscious. F.R.I.D.A.Y. reads his vitals and informs Stark that he is still alive. Wilson lands and tells Stark that he is sorry. Stark, distraught, blasts Falcon in the chest, signalling the end of the conflict.","id":"T_BBCF7CC9BE63E2285034F4D0E78B0DE9","title":"Clash of the Avengers : Clash of the Avengers : Battle","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_BBCF7CC9BE63E2285034F4D0E78B0DE9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Clash of the Avengers-156427.html","title":"Clash of the Avengers : Clash of the Avengers : Battle","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34068869.xml","DOCNO":"BBCF7CC9BE63E228902156E4404D4240","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_BBCF7CC9BE63E228902156E4404D4240"}},{"value":"0.016142060980200768","text":" At Iron Man's command, Spider-Man, in an improved suit, revealed himself at the during the Clash of the Avengers and stole Captain America's Shield with his webbing, before getting distracted at seeing his heroes, the Avengers, and calling Captain America his hero, much to Iron Man's annoyance. Iron Man and Captain America continued to argue about the Sokovia Accords until they reached their breaking point. Spider-Man was surprised by Ant-Man at first, who managed to sneak atop the shield and strike Spider-Man in order to return the shield to Captain America. As the former teammates began to fight, Spider-Man asked Iron Man what to do. He told Spider-Man to keep his distance and webbed Captain America and his companions up, as Stark did not want to hurt any of them. He then followed Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Spider-Man chased Falcon and the Winter Soldier in the airport terminal building by crawling along the outside windows. He then smashed through the glass panel and with one kick Spider-Man smashed Falcon to the ground and then turned his attention to the Winter Soldier. While stopping a punch from Winter Soldier, Spider-Man became distracted and amused by his metal arm. During a quick battle with Falcon, he webbed him to some hand railings in the terminal building but again became distracted, this time by Falcon's wings asking him if they were made from carbon fiber. Soon after, the Winter Soldier tried to intervene but Spider-Man was able to web him and Falcon up. However, the hero was soon snatched away by Redwing. Afterward, he rejoined his fellow teammates and he fought with Captain America, who both had a mutual respect towards each other, and managed to give him a good fight but eventually lost. When Captain America forced him to hold up a platform, to which he was impressed by Spider-Man's strength; he then casually asked Spider-Man where he was from before escaping. During the battle, War Machine was thrown through the air by a giant Ant-Man and was about to smash into an aircraft parked outside the airport, but fortunately Spider-Man saved him by firing a web line at War Machine and pulling him away from the aircraft just in the nick of time. At the end of the battle, Spider-Man, inspired by the movie The Empire Strikes Back, came up with a strategy to defeat a gigantic Ant-Man. He webbed up his knees so that Ant-Man lost his stand, and then let Iron Man and War Machine hit him against the helmet with full speed. Ant-Man fell over, hitting Parker, making him fly into a pile of wooden boxes; knocking him unconscious for a short while. After the battle, Iron Man quickly checked to see if he was alright and told the exhausted Parker that he was done and should go home threatening to call his Aunt May if he didn't. Feeling that he had disappointed Stark, Parker desperately tried to convince Iron Man that he could still keep fighting, but soon agreed whilst Iron Man flew away, claiming \"yeah, I'm done\".","id":"T_43DC7B1E0A49E620BF26702369F414EE","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Clash of the Avengers","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_43DC7B1E0A49E620BF26702369F414EE/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man-68580.html","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Clash of the Avengers","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096091.xml","DOCNO":"43DC7B1E0A49E6208D44DF745265E142","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_43DC7B1E0A49E6208D44DF745265E142"}},{"value":"0.014556048437952995","text":" Real Name Peter Parker Alias(es) Spider-Man, Spider-Boy, Spiderling, Crime-Fighting-Spider, Underoos, Tough Guy Species Human Citizenship American Gender Male Age 15[1] Status Alive Movie Ant-Man (mentioned), Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Homecoming (unreleased) Game Lego Marvel's Avengers Portrayed by Tom Holland","id":"T_43DC7B1E0A49E620E1AB8EF964BA7785","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Infobox Spider-Man:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_43DC7B1E0A49E620E1AB8EF964BA7785/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man-68580.html","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Infobox Spider-Man:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096049.xml","DOCNO":"43DC7B1E0A49E62074409D501167F88C","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_43DC7B1E0A49E62074409D501167F88C"}},{"value":"0.014304183423519135","text":" Spider-Man: Homecoming, is a 2017 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man.

It is the first major film franchise to cross the $9 billion and $10 billion marks. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is the highest-grossing franchise of all time. Due to financial difficulties Marvel faced in the past, they had to sell the film rights to several of their comic book characters. Some of these sales are still in effect today, and thus the characters cannot be used in the MCU. Due to Fox owning the rights to the X-Men franchise, the X-Men films take place in a different universe to the MCU. Fox also owns the rights to the Fantastic Four film franchises. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch fall under both companies rights, as they are mutants by origin but are heavily associated with The Avengers. Both companies have certain limitations however. Fox cannot make any reference to the Twins' involvement with the Avengers. Marvel cannot make any reference to the Twins being mutants, the children of Magneto, or their association with the X-Men. Similarly, Spider-Man's film rights are owned by Sony, and both the Sam Raimi series and The Amazing Spider-Man series were set separate from the MCU; although after the last movie in the latter franchise, a deal was made between the two companies, resulting in another reboot of the series, this time making it set in the MCU. The initial indication of an element of cooperation between Sony and Disney was when Sony gave permission for Disney to use the OsCorp Building for a background cameo in The Avengers; however, due to budget and time constraints the idea was abandoned. Furthermore, Andrew Garfield, the actor who played Spider-Man in the Amazing Spider-Man series, had expressed interest in appearing in an Avengers sequel. On February 10th 2015, it was announced that Sony and Disney had struck a deal for setting Spider-Man in the MCU. The character, played by Tom Holland, is set to make his first appearance in the MCU in Captain America: Civil War followed by the second reboot of the franchise, a solo film titled Spider-Man: Homecoming which is set to release in 2017. Additionally, it was announced that Sony would have full creative control over the character and the franchise whilst setting it in the MCU, allowing characters from other MCU properties to appear in it and vice-versa. Additionally, the planned spin-offs to the franchise by Sony are also reportedly in development, but has since abandoned after The Amazing Spider-Man 3's cancellation. The cinematic rights to Namor lie with Marvel Studios currently but due to 'older contracts with other parties' it seems they couldn't use them yet. As of June 2016, the films rights to Namor now lies with Marvel Studios, and can now be used for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The cinematic rights to Man-Thing lie with Marvel Studios, while they originally used to lie with Lionsgate and thus he couldn't be used in the MCU at that time. After the release of Iron Man, Marvel Studios made a deal to produce five further movies with Paramount Pictures - Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers and Iron Man 3. In 2009, Disney purchased Marvel and gained the distribution rights to The Avengers and Iron Man 3. In 2013, they gained the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to close the acquisition of Marvel.The Incredible Hulk is the only MCU film not currently owned by Disney due to a separate agreement between Marvel and Universal Studios. A recurring theme in the solo movies is that the main protagonist often isn't the one who defeats the main antagonist, or needs help from an ally to do so. Iron Monger and Aldrich Killian were killed by Pepper Potts, and War Machine helped Iron Man defeat Whiplash, who ends up committing suicide. Thor's fight with Loki was interrupted by Odin, and Malekith was killed by Erik Selvig. Red Skull was vanished by the Tesseract, Nick Fury shot Alexander Pierce, and Captain America's fight with Winter Soldier ended as a stalemate. Hulk and Ant-Man are currently the only exceptions, as they defeated Abomination and Yellowjacket respectively by themselves.","id":"T_575E9BCCF3CD245D165FB1C52A5E88D6","title":"Marvel Cinematic Universe : Marvel Cinematic Universe : Trivia","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_575E9BCCF3CD245D165FB1C52A5E88D6/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Marvel Cinematic Universe-2027.html","title":"Marvel Cinematic Universe : Marvel Cinematic Universe : Trivia","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34085722.xml","DOCNO":"575E9BCCF3CD245DE2074BB5B5DEA951","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_575E9BCCF3CD245DE2074BB5B5DEA951"}},{"value":"0.012918390333652496","text":" Full Credits for Spider-Man: Homecoming.","id":"T_C2D431E6D35532482377E4158C484BED","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_C2D431E6D35532482377E4158C484BED/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man_ Homecoming_Credits-68659.html","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096070.xml","DOCNO":"C2D431E6D3553248D6A5A14E4DD6FC37","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_C2D431E6D3553248D6A5A14E4DD6FC37"}},{"value":"0.012793910689651966","text":" Release Dates for Spider-Man: Homecoming.

Arriving in Germany, Clint Barton puts Scott Lang in the back of a van as him and Maximoff drive to meet Rogers at the Flughafen Leipzig-Halle airport. On the way, Lang falls asleep in the van. Sharon Carter drives Steve Rogers, Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes to the Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, managing to smuggle Captain America's Shield and the EXO-7 Falcon suit out of the Joint Counter Terrorist Center to return them to their owners. Rogers thanks Carter for all her help, and the two share a kiss, which they both agree was long overdue between the two of them. Barton then arrives with Maximoff and Lang, and when he wakes up Lang, he is very awestruck to meet his hero, Captain America. Him and Wilson share a joke about the last time they met, and Lang agrees to help them. They then hear that Stark and his team have arrived and shut down the airport, and Rogers tells his team to \"suit up\". Clash of the Avengers: Around 24 hours after Thaddeus Ross gave Stark his 36 hour deadline, Iron Man and his team confront Captain America and some of his team at the airport, bringing in Spider-Man in his new suit to bind Captain America's hands with his webbing and steal his shield. When Rogers refuses to listen to Stark and back down, Ant-Man steals Captain America's Shield back for him, and Hawkeye shoots an arrow to break the webbing binding between Captain America's hands, and a battle breaks out between Iron Man and Captain America's two teams. Iron Man goes to apprehend Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch, but the two work together to bring cars crashing down on Stark and keep him trapped temporarily. Meanwhile, Spider-Man swings in to take out Winter Soldier and Falcon, using his super strength to block Barnes' punches, and his webbing to stop Falcon's wings from working. As he fights the two, he continuously spouts witty lines and jokes, something which Falcon picks up on. When it seems like Spider-Man has the two defeated, Falcon uses Redwing to grab Spider-Man and throw him out of the airport window. As everyone escapes the various predicaments they have got themselves into, the twelve heroes all end up coming together in the airplane parking area outside the airport. The six heroes on each side begin to run at each other, and all the heroes pair off, clashing with each other, each in an attempt to subdue and take down the other, but with no one having the desire to kill anyone else. In the process, Black Panther gets in a hand-to-hand fight with Barnes, who tells him that he did not kill his father, but T'Challa does not believe him. A massive battle unfolds, resulting in the destruction of much of the airport. Rogers and Barnes, however, know they need a way to get to Siberia so as to stop Zemo from reactivating the five Winter Soldiers. They notice Stark's Quinjet parked in a section of the airport, and realize that they are going to need a distraction so as to escape in the jet. Ant-Man volunteers a distraction he has attempted in a laboratory before, using his suit to make himself grow to be giant instead of shrinking. Taking Iron Man's team by surprise, the team work on taking down Ant-Man's new \"Giant-Man\" form and all but momentarily forget about Captain America and the Winter Soldier. After Giant-Man grabs War Machine, Spider-Man wraps his webbing around Giant-Man's legs to make him fall over. Meanwhile, Vision notices Captain America and the Winter Soldier running for the Quinjet, and causes a tower to fall on them to stop them reaching it. Scarlet Witch manages to use her telekinesis to hold up the tower long enough to allow them to reach the jet's hangar. However, they find that Black Widow is waiting for them inside the hangar, and worry that she is about to try to stop them. Instead though, turning against Iron Man's team as she uses her Black Widow's Bite to subdue Black Panther, who had quietly made it into the hangar after the two as well. She allows Rogers and Barnes to escape in the Quinjet, simply telling T'Challa that she said she would help find Rogers, not catch him. As the Quinjet flies away, War Machine and Iron Man fly in pursuit, and Falcon flies after them to help his friends escape. Iron Man gets Vision to try to shoot Falcon's wings to stop him from catching them, but Vision is momentarily distracted by trying to comfort Scarlet Witch and misses the shot he fires from the Mind Stone in his forehead, catching War Machine's arc reactor instead of Falcon's wings, and causing Rhodes to fall uncontrollably from the sky. He crashes to the ground before Iron Man or Falcon can catch him. He survives the fall, but is severely injured, and the Quinjet flies away. Iron Man takes out Falcon in rage, and the authorities soon arrive to arrest Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch and Falcon. Parker soon returns home. Zemo touches down in Moscow and starts traveling up to Siberia.","id":"T_369EAD1423389E9B49622479C1BFFB9","title":"2016 : 2016 : 9th","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_369EAD1423389E9B49622479C1BFFB9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"2016-160153.html","title":"2016 : 2016 : 9th","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34060297.xml","DOCNO":"369EAD1423389E9B7C9AC2A47F6ABA5E","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_369EAD1423389E9B7C9AC2A47F6ABA5E"}},{"value":"0.012761627323925495","text":" Title: Spider-Man: Homecoming/Release Dates Wikia URL: http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming/Release_Dates Article ID: 68665 Categories: Release Dates, Spider-Man: Homecoming","id":"T_AE1D8B7F2FBBAF63D7D7EB2BE322AFBE","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Release Dates : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Release Dates : Meta information:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_AE1D8B7F2FBBAF63D7D7EB2BE322AFBE/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man_ Homecoming_Release Dates-68665.html","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Release Dates : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Release Dates : Meta information:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096084.xml","DOCNO":"AE1D8B7F2FBBAF6330022A108D9B0BBF","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_AE1D8B7F2FBBAF6330022A108D9B0BBF"}},{"value":"0.012623933143913746","text":" According to Kevin Feige, Spider-Man: Homecoming is set to begin production in June 2016.

Partnering with Lions Gate Entertainment in 2004, Marvel plans to enter the direct-to-DVD market with eight animated films with Lionsgate handling distribution. Marvel entered into a non-recourse financing structure with Merrill Lynch Commercial Finance Corp. that is collateralized by certain movie rights to a total of 10 characters from Marvel's vast vault. Marvel gets $525 million to make a maximum of 10 movies based on the company's properties over eight years, according to the parameters of the deal with Paramount in September 2004. Those properties were: Ant-Man, The Avengers, Black Panther, Captain America, Cloak & Dagger, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Power Pack, Shang-Chi. In 2005, Michael Helfant joined the studio as President and Chief Operating Officer. In November 2005, Marvel gained the film rights to Iron Man from New Line Cinema. In 2006, Marvel revealed that it has regained the film rights to The Incredible Hulk. April 2006, Paramount Pictures acquired the rights to Thor from Sony. That year the film was announced to be a Marvel Studios production. Lions Gate Entertainment subsequently dropped the Black Widow motion picture project it had since 2004 giving the rights back to Marvel. In March 2007, David Maisel was named Chairman and Kevin Feige was named President of Production as Iron Man began filming. In 2008, Marvel Studios signed a lease with Raleigh Studios to host its headquarters and production offices and film the next four movies on the studios' slate, including Iron Man 2 and Thor, at their Manhattan Beach facilities. In 2009, Marvel attempted to hire a team of writers to help come up with creative ways to launch its lesser-known properties, such as Black Panther, Cable, Iron Fist, Nighthawk, and Vision. On December 31, 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. Both Marvel and Disney have stated that the merger would not affect any preexisting deals with other film studios for the time being, although Disney said they would consider distributing future Marvel projects with their own studios once the current deals expired. On October 18, 2010, Disney bought the distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures. In June 2010, Marvel set up a television division headed up by Jeph Loeb as Executive Vice President. Beginning with Thor: The Dark World, the Marvel Studios logo was given a makeover and its own fanfare by composer Brian Tyler. According to Kevin Feige, this was to symbolize Marvel as its own entity within the Walt Disney Company since Thor: The Dark World would be the first movie to only feature the studio's logo without any other. On February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios announced a deal that would introduce Spider-Man into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, allowing Spider-Man characters to appear in Marvel Studios films, as well as Marvel Studios characters in Sony Pictures films. Under this deal, Sony would co-produce the new Spider-Man series with Marvel Studios, while Sony would still finance, own, distribute, and have final creative control over the projects. This set Spider-Man to show up in one Marvel Studios film before his MCU solo-film debut in Spider-Man: Homecoming to be released on July 28, 2017. This was the previous release date of Thor: Ragnarok, since which its release date was pushed back along with Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Inhumans. In August 2015, after the release of Ant-Man, Disney and Marvel underwent a reorganization with Feige no longer reporting to Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, but to Disney Studios CEO Alan F. Horn.","id":"T_DAE2E0CD4F56FF78BC95AAD826DC08BF","title":"Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_DAE2E0CD4F56FF78BC95AAD826DC08BF/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Marvel Studios-2084.html","title":"Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios : Marvel Studios","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34085841.xml","DOCNO":"DAE2E0CD4F56FF7886A780552232F78F","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_DAE2E0CD4F56FF7886A780552232F78F"}},{"value":"0.012178884819149971","text":" On February 9, 2015, Sony Pictures Studios and Marvel Studios announced that Spider-Man would appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character appearing in a Marvel Cinematic Universe film and Sony releasing a Spider-Man film co-produced by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on July 28, 2017, with Sony Pictures continuing to own, finance, distribute, and having final creative control of the Spider-Man films.

Kevin Feige has said that this storyline will focus on government regulation of the heroes after the battle in Avengers: Age of Ultron. Peggy Carter's speech that her niece Sharon quoted during her eulogy is the same speech Captain America gave to Spider-Man in Amazing Spider-Man, during the Civil War storyline. In the film both Scott Lang becoming Giant-Man and War Machine getting badly injured are a nod towards the second Giant-Man in the comics Bill Foster who was an Anti-Registration hero in the Civil War who was killed by Thor's clone Ragnarok, who unlike Vision in the film did it on his own accord, rather than by accident. In the Civil War comics, Spider-Man was on the Pro-Registration side until he defected to the Anti-Registration side after learning how they were imprisoning the captured heroes in the Negative Zone without due process until they agreed to register. In the film, after Spider-Man is injured during the battle at the airport in Germany, Iron Man removes him from the team and sends him back home to New York.","id":"T_6C07DD604F963FBC3B60859B54A15923","title":"Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Parallelisms with the Civil War comic book storyline","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_6C07DD604F963FBC3B60859B54A15923/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Captain America_ Civil War_Trivia-47506.html","title":"Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Captain America: Civil War/Trivia : Parallelisms with the Civil War comic book storyline","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34067443.xml","DOCNO":"6C07DD604F963FBCABFA41CC15CB11FC","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_6C07DD604F963FBCABFA41CC15CB11FC"}},{"value":"0.011908541433513165","text":" Title: Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits Wikia URL: http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming/Credits Article ID: 68659 Categories: Full Credits, Spider-Man: Homecoming","id":"T_C2D431E6D3553248494DFB199CD7FA9","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Meta information:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_C2D431E6D3553248494DFB199CD7FA9/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man_ Homecoming_Credits-68659.html","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Credits : Meta information:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096066.xml","DOCNO":"C2D431E6D35532481DED4AFC1D599821","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_C2D431E6D35532481DED4AFC1D599821"}},{"value":"0.011872471310198307","text":" Title: Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia Wikia URL: http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man:_Homecoming/Trivia Article ID: 70869 Categories: Trivia, Spider-Man: Homecoming","id":"T_B0F686B3D8C132A0AD0AA895ECC3BCE4","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Meta information:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_B0F686B3D8C132A0AD0AA895ECC3BCE4/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man_ Homecoming_Trivia-70869.html","title":"Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Spider-Man: Homecoming/Trivia : Meta information:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096071.xml","DOCNO":"B0F686B3D8C132A09BE7B2605FD481AB","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_B0F686B3D8C132A09BE7B2605FD481AB"}},{"value":"0.011515325866639614","text":" Title: Spider-Man Wikia URL: http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Spider-Man Article ID: 68580 Categories: Captain America: Civil War Characters, Spider-Man: Homecoming Characters, Video Games Characters, Humans, Brown Hair, Brown Eyes, Students, Heroes, Vigilantes","id":"T_43DC7B1E0A49E620CBBDB8B31DC1C7D","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Meta information:","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_43DC7B1E0A49E620CBBDB8B31DC1C7D/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man-68580.html","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Meta information:","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096047.xml","DOCNO":"43DC7B1E0A49E620228B80981E060CBB","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_43DC7B1E0A49E620228B80981E060CBB"}},{"value":"0.011452299542725086","text":"A neophyte to being a superhero, Parker idolizes Iron Man and sees him as a role model.

Upon entering his apartment and greeting his aunt May, he mentioned that there was a \"crazy\" car parked outside when he realized that they had a famous visitor: Tony Stark. Parker was caught off-guard and speechless about meeting his biggest idol and was confused when Stark told his aunt that Stark Industries planned to give Parker a sizable grant that Stark manages for gifted students (claiming that Parker had signed up for it), which was actually a pretense for Stark to meet Parker. When he realized this, he played along, making up that he had planned to surprise his Aunt May with it, and led Stark to his room where they could talk in private. Parker was shocked and tried to act nonchalant when Stark showed him footage of the rumored \"Spider-Man\" that was said to be active in New York City for several months. His videos showed a figure in red and blue clothing apprehending criminals and stopping speeding cars with his bare hands. Stark jokingly wondered if that figure wasn't Parker, to which he reacted with very clumsy excuses that Stark didn't buy. Parker claimed that the video must be fake and that it was somehow made on a computer. Parker's cover blew completely when Stark instantly discovered the secret hiding place of the makeshift outfit that Parker used as his costume. Parker had no other choice than to confess that he was indeed Spider-Man and has been for about six months. Stark jokingly ridiculed Parker for his cheap costume, but was impressed by, and complimented his self-made web-shooters. Landing mainly on the remarkable tensile strength of the synthetic webbing that Parker created, Stark quickly recognized himself in Parker because of his affinity towards science and even more so, when Parker mentioned a tragic event in his past that lead to him taking on a responsibility that most people could not take. He decided to take the boy under his wing and invited him to come to Germany with him, to which Parker replied that he had homework to do. Stark jokingly threatened to tell his aunt May that he was Spider-Man to coerce Parker to come with him. While Stark led himself towards the door, Parker over-reacted for a moment and webbed his hand next to the door knob. He finally realized that he should take this offer, and left with Stark after freeing his hand from the door awkwardly.","id":"T_43DC7B1E0A49E6207D80C8D0FEBF3518","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Recruited by Tony Stark","document":"/instance/518/deepqa/v1/question/document/T_43DC7B1E0A49E6207D80C8D0FEBF3518/0/-1","copyright":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights","termsOfUse":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","metadataMap":{"originalfile":"Spider-Man-68580.html","title":"Spider-Man : Spider-Man : Recruited by Tony Stark","corpusName":"PB","fileName":"/watsondata/ingestion/1552ad7f6ed/working/20160609215741/eng/di/output/trec/intermediate/xml-splitTrecTrim/34096081.xml","DOCNO":"43DC7B1E0A49E62065AEACF9C556622A","CorpusPlusDocno":"PB_43DC7B1E0A49E62065AEACF9C556622A"}},{"value":"0.011108099482953548","text":" James Rhodes/War Machine is one of five characters who are played by a different actor in different films.

However in the comics, it was in fact Norman Osborn who wore the Iron Patriot armor but due to Sony owning the film rights to Spider-Man (and everything Spider-Man related) and Norman Osborn also being the Green Goblin, from Spider-Man's rogue gallery, Osborn could not appear in a Marvel Studios film at that time. After the release of Iron Man 3, for a time, the mainstream counterpart of Rhodey has also taken the mantle of Iron Patriot in the comics, before later going back to the War Machine armor. As War Machine, James Rhodes became the first African American superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
